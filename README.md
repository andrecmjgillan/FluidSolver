Below is the software project I completed for the project portion of my Master's degree
it is an interactive fluid solver based on "Real-time fluid mechanics for games" (Jos Stam, 2003)
with modifications for color advection/diffusion, temperature for smoke simulation, a toolbox to support
the user interface, etc.
please see the document related to the project for more information
here's the source code, I was able to create a linux executable using pyinstaller but I won't distribute that
Depenencies include PyOpenGL, numpy, Thorpy, and Pygame
